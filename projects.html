        <h3>Taste of code website.</h3>
        <p>This was a school project where we had to make a website for the taste of code, we worked in groups of four. I mostly worked on the showcase page, i'm also pretty sure they didn't use the website in the end.</p>

        <h3>Blender Animation</h3>
        <p>This was also a school project, we had to make an animation to raise awareness for children in difficult situations, the animation didn't turn out that well, mostly because i had to make a single character and miserably failed at it (i didn't have enough time to color it and i messed up on making bones for the character and didn't have time to change them.)</p>

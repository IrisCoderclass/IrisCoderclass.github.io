        <h3>Well hello.. i guess.</h3>
        <p>Hello there welcome on my website.</p>
        <p>Well this is awkward... i don't really know what to say.</p>
        <p>I guess i need to introduce myself first.</p>
        <p>My name is Iris Postma, at the moment i'm writing this i'm 13 years old(it's currently 15 september 2017, my birthday is on august 14th so i guess that'll kinda give you an idea about my age).</p>
        <p>I go to school at the Metis Montessori Lyceum in the Netherlands, i am in the coderclass where i basically learn coding i guess... the reason i'm in this class is because i want to make video games, i already have a lot of idea's that i really want to make reality.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are Gaming, Drawing and basically anything that has to do with stories(i really like making my own stories).</p>

        <h3>What this website is for.</h3>
        <p>So this website is here because my teachers want me to make a portfolio, so thats the main thing you can find here, apart from that i just put some random stuff on here cause i think it's funny and want other people to see it.</p>
        <p>So the webpages you can find here are:</p>
        <p>Home, this is the page you are on right now this is where i tell you who i am and what this page is for.</p>
        <p>Portfolio, this is where i put everything my teachers want me to put on here.</p>
        <p>Hakanbot news, like i said i also put stuff here because i just want to... and i enjoy making stories, this is basically a story in the form of a bunch of (most definetely fake) news articles about our teacher having his intelligence cloned into a bunch of robots, it's very unrealistic and i really wonder why this is what goes on in my 13 year old mind.</p>
        <p>Grot-148, ok so, "grot" means cave(you'll know why i called it that if you read hakanbot news), it actually has nothing to do with caves, it's basically just me talking about the progress i've made learning about coding, and the progress i've maded towards my goals.</p>
